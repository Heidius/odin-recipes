    <h2>-- Description --</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Pizza Margherita, also known as Margherita pizza,together with the pizza
      marinara, the typical Neapolitan pizza.<br />
      It is roundish in shape with a raised edge (the cornicione) and seasoned
      with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior
      di latte), fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil.<br />
      The dough is made by mixing water, salt, and yeast (either sourdough, or
      fresh or dry baker's yeast) with flour.<br />
      The dough is stretched by the pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') in a motion going
      outwards from the center, pressing with the fingers of both hands on the
      dough ball, and flipping it several times, shaping it into a disc. It is
      then topped and baked in an oven,

    <h2>-- Steps --</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Make the base</em></strong>
        <p>
          Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make
          a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together
          with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.<br />
          Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.
          Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise
          if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Make the sauce:</em></strong>
        <p>
          Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to
          taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with
          shaping the base.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Roll out the dough:</em></strong>
        <p>
          If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into
          two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds,
          about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very
          thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured
          baking sheets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Top and bake:</em></strong>
        <p>
          heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an
          upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over
          bases with the back of a spoon. <br />Scatter with cheese and
          tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on
          its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.<br />
          Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil,
          and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
